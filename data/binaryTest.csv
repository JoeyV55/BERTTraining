suggesting will not work if we set a character/set of characters as an action keyword because then we wouldnt be able to search for programs starting with those characterswe can have a colon as you suggested but that defeats the purpose of removing the space if we were to set a colon then we could instead leave the space as is to not complicate how it works we can always tweak the working based

(like someone may delete a drop down by selecting none so another drop downs list may have to be refreshed which could mess up an existing selection) thats why when this was initially made we went the route of showing warnings when a user selects a & b together for example rather than making the drop down show only modifiers/only action keys it sounds like it could be a lot of changes> along with that i noticed that it would be good to have `boxlist` of `comboboxitem`s so we can attach key code as value in that way we can throw away indexes logic so we do not have to rely on the exact order in the two arrays(key codes and key code names) what do you think?> it will help if we want to keep different amount of keys in different orders for dropdowns> should we implement it in this pull request or create separate issue?this sounds good but i think its better to create a separate issue for this to keep the scope of this pr smaller i think while the change to comboboxitems is made it could also be possible to do the ""not show disable in the drop down"" and similar for modifier/action keys like it could be something like if there is only 1 drop down you can choose any key and if there are more the non-last dropdowns will have only modifier keys and the last one again allows you to choose any (except disable since that is a separate case) since a lot more features have been added in this code space recently (like key to shortcut/shortcut to key disable being added now etc) i think there are some places for cleaning up the ui code like this || > * one ui case where it is possible to select modifier+disable (ive mentioned in a separate comment the missing code)> * there is one more place in the shortcutcontrol file where getkeycodelist has to be replaced with the new version for the first call it should have `renderdisabled` as false and for second it should be trueit is two more reasons to implement https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/issues/6913 || does this implement @jmahlerss pr from https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/pull/6236 or the two are related but independent?  || it was built on top of it adding tests and implementing the shortcut disable feature as well along with some tweaks || "

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"[kbm] added banded rows ## summary of the pull request_what is this about?_- banded rows are added for remap keys and remap shortcuts windows- the grid was replaced with stackpanel as it is hard to accomplish with the grid- i tried to make minimum changes to accomplish it- it seems like we can do a better job with ui part it is important to achieve encapsulation of components it feels unnatural when `keydropdowncontrol` functions have grid as a parameter but it is not a priority now as that part will be migrated to xaml## pr checklist* [x] applies to #2659* [x] cla signed if not go over [here](https://claopensourcemicrosoftcom/microsoft/powertoys) and sign the cla* [x] tests added/passed* [ ] requires documentation to be updated* [ ] ive discussed this with core contributors already if not checked im ready to accept this work might be rejected in favor of a different grand plan issue number where discussion took place: #xxx## info on pull request_what does this include?_- layout was changed from grid to stackpanel- grid and stackpanel parameters were replaced to `rowindex` in some functions because it simplifies things- banded rows are accomplished manually that means if the number of rows changes the background of rows should be updated- arrow column width is hardcoded now before it was calculated as table width minus width of other columns other columns and table widths were hardcoded so it does not make the difference_how does someone test & validate?_- test all functionality of remap keys and remap shortcuts windows- test the same

two aspects of the same problem other than this kbm works  || @ivan100sic good catch! the problem was that callbacks capture row id as integer so after deleting a row indexes shifts and it crashes

extendeturiparser we hafe a selection if it is http https or an other uri type if you add a new return value or property that decides if it is default browser or app handler then you can choose different result properties (maybe we need a custom class for that)we currently do have the return value `true` and `false` to indicate if the uri format is valid we cloud change the return type to string (or add another `out` parameter) to indicate: 1 an uri to be handled by the browser (`http` `https`)2 an uri to be handled by the application (`mailto:` `ftp:` `ms-settings`)3 an invalid uri or do you have a better suggestion? :) ---note: the commit below this is a wip just for me to switch between my computers ill amend it later please ignore it and its pipeline error || > >can you explain the problem a bit more i dont unterstand your problem what do you need/expect instead?> > @htcfreek ive found difficulties to tell `https://` is valid and `ms-settings://` is invalid the only way i thought is hard-coded `http://` and `https://` as a valid format but the rest of it not this doesnt seem to be a good solution > lets ignore that as do as if ms-settings:// is valid the opens only on the main page instead of the sub page i dont we should add complexity because of this> >i agree we should not introduce a new plugin either we handle it by uri plugin or we add it to program plugin which makes more sense to me these uris are used to open apps> > ill keep it into the uri handler based on the reason written in the first part of this comment >👍🏻> >in the extendeturiparser we hafe a

to the browser for now and ill open another pr to send the application uri to the apps handler :) || according to [rfc3986](https://datatrackerietforg/doc/html/rfc3986) an uri has two slashes at the beginning of the hier-part when the uri scheme accepts authority pathsmaybe we should also add test for uris with authority paths like `ftp://user:password@localhost:8080`  || > according to

discussed this in the comments before might be part of a second

is that itll keep the same item and say the action is to open it in browser which is not true anymorei think the places to fix this would be either here:https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/blob/9d9df949efebae1f8131482fc53cbb17e8b87725/src/modules/launcher/plugins/microsoftpluginuri/maincs#l66-l70or here:https://githubcom/microsoft/powertoys/blob/9d9df949efebae1f8131482fc53cbb17e8b87725/src/modules/launcher/plugins/microsoftpluginuri/maincs#l95-l99if this is a multi pr feature it should be merged into another branch first and only merged to main after all the prs go indoes this make sense?do you want me to create this branch? || @jaimecbernardo lets ask @franky920920 he is the pr owner || @jaimecbernardo agree please create a branch for this and merge this pr into it this became a larger work item than i expected and not possible for me to complete it in a single pr  || thank youpointing it to `feature/ptrun_application_uri` || "
