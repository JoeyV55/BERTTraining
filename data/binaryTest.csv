* rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed  the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodel s  generalsettingsconfig  a public static variable. * the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up.     public shellpage()         {             initializecomponent()               datacontext = viewmodel              shellhandler = this              viewmodel.initialize(shellframe  navigationview  keyboardaccelerators)              shellframe.navigate(typeof(generalpage))          }     * therefore  the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in it s constructor. the generalviewmodel tries to open the settings.json file and loads the information from it if it exists  if not it creates a new settings.json file. hence  this variable is always initialized when settings is running. this is also the only time the settings.json file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention). from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the  generalsettingsconfig  in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file.   might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol).     _?_  * all tests pass (the format had to be changed for initializing generalsettings based on the code changes). * manually validated in release as well as in debug mode that the crash no longer occurs. * also validated that the converters work as expected by changing the theme.
