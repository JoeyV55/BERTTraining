or should i go  digging in the history? 😉 || so i re-implemented parsing and serialization of content selectors and added tests for it it is probably not the most beautiful fashion but i need to (want to) link to the old code and not have to re-write the gui speaking of the gui: the content selectors seem to be working fine if the metadata is in the bib file the gui in the entryeditor is not actually beautiful but i guess it has never been (does anybody feel like polishing the ui?) however i do not see options –> manage content selectors maybe that has not been ported from  #2068 yet? maybe someone who is more familiar with the menu than me can have a look? :)finally the test currently say:```netsfjabreflogichelphelpfiletest > refertovalidpage failed```although there seems to be a help page here: http://helpjabreforg/en/contentselector someone certainly has a pointer for that?

|| ok seems we are back on track only the google scholar test is failing now which i hope is just a random connection problem on the side of travis the same might have applied for the help file testso now we can do some more code review and at a certain point have the users from #2221 try out the feature to make sure that it works || @tobiasdiez i addressed most of your comments i agree that ""content selectors"" is probably not the most appropriate name for the stuff this feature does but it is the name under which it has existed for a long time and is known at least by some people i would say that consistency in naming tops appropriateness of the namefurthermore i removed the entry editors update code as you asked for the updating of the content selectors did not even work with this code i tried to replace it with something else and failed so for now you have to restart jabref to get a change in the content selectors to work maybe someone from @jabref/developers can provide a hint on how the refresh of the entry editor should work?finally i will leave the problems in the localization for @siedlerchr to fix :) || closing and reopening of the entry editor does not work? (potentially with selecting another entry?) || @matthiasgeiger unfortunately not the changed data makes it into the metadata but the gui does not notice it is only up-to-date when the metadata is re-read from disk and the entryeditor is re-built closing and reopening the bib file does the trick or restarting jabref || so we would like to get this into v38 which hopefully can be released in december what is missing: - [ ] correct the language files - [ ] have selector keywords updated without reloading of the bib file - [ ] have the users play around with it to see if it really worksi was hoping that @siedlerchr could do the first two points and hopefully soon :-) @siedlerchr what is your opinion on that? || yeah i will try to work on it at least i tried to fix the language files yesterday i will continue working on it the weekend || "

most of the conversion looks good concerning your questions:1 the exporter and importer tests use a filename-based convention to find and check the tests for example https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/blob/57126659b4f8ff58c9403af0f4d6aabccf77058c/src/test/java/org/jabref/logic/exporter/modsexportformattestfilesjava#l59-l66finds all files that start with `mods` there are usually two files with the same name: one with `bib` ending and one with `xml` the tests then should test that exporting the content of the bib file using the mods-exporter give the contents of the `xml` file2 yes there is not yet a release of the new archunit so for now the architecture tests can stay using junit 4the mockito runner is not really needed its only purpose is to support the `@mock` annotation but you can always use `variable  mock()` 3 currently there is no neat way to handle this problem (see the open https://githubcom/junit-team/junit5/issues/878)4 looks good5 i think the problem is the setup in https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/pull/4260/files#diff-2e1fadfb1af8461d9d830981c338f225r64 the bib file should reside on the same level as the pdf folder (and not within) || @tobiasdiez  thanks for your answer!

ive got a little bit about the ""cannot find test files"" problem and ive fixed them in 2 commits the first uses the origin junit 4 the second uses junit 5but some tests in `modsexportformattestfilesjava` and `msbibexportformattestfilesjava` failed they failed both in the origin junit 4 and the version i write junit 5 here is an example for `msbibexportformattestfilesjava` ![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/25541992/44089397-320a7a34-9ff9-11e8-8002-8034da799d37png)![image](https://user-imagesgithubusercontentcom/25541992/44089412-46064ae0-9ff9-11e8-8e95-43068246a88fpng)so is that ok just for the migrate task? is there something else i can do to improve that?and also a big thank for @siedlerchr s patch )----------------------------------------------------------hmmm looks like i still got the wrong path || i remember that we had problems with this before that some resources were not int he right folder i will take a look at that || that now some of the exporter tests fail were my fear this probably needs further investigations and fixes for the exporter thus it goes beyond the current pr thus i propose to mark the tests as ignored/disabled for now and we will come back later to fix them  || i am just investigating this and i think i found the issue with the paths || its a classpath issue for exmaple:```        path path  pathsget(msbibexportformattestfilesclassgetresource("""")touri()) > returns e:\workspace\jabref\jabref\bin\main\org\jabref\logic\exporter``` although it should be bin/test || okay i found the issue with the paths i really wondered if it ever worked but well now it does the key is to point to one existing resource the rest can be found dynamically and this leads us actually to some failing tests but i would ignore that for the moment that is a difference @metatronwings  you can use this patch as a start for all the related importer/exporter tests[0001-fix-resolving-of-paths-in-msbibexporterpathpatchtxt](https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/files/2287509/0001-fix-resolving-of-paths-in-msbibexporterpathpatchtxt) || im very glad to see this issue will be resolved by us soon only a few more small questions: **1 some tests have not been migrated yet**the `dbmssynchronizertestjava` and `synchronizationtestsimulatorjava` have not been migrated yet as there is no good way to handle chaos code after migration (see example in `dbmsprocessortestjava`)do i need to migrate them?the `mainarchitecturetestswitharchunitjava` have not too as there is not yet a release of the new archunit**2 since i didnt migrate them how should i write the** `changelogmd` **?**and thanks for all of you! 👍 || @metatronwings  its okay we will sure find a way for them in the long run not that importantyou dont need to add a changelog entry as this is only a code-quality issue which will not have any impact on the normal jabref user we hope you enjoyed it and if you want you can also further contribute looking to see more from you ) || i just converted the two other classes with the legacy file methods to use the nio stuff[0001-include-main-java-in-resources-as-wellpatchtxt](https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/files/2290800/0001-include-main-java-in-resources-as-wellpatchtxt) || sorry but i must do that tomorrow morning because its 12:00pm in my timezone thanks for the patch!

thanks!then as a second step we should discuss in the devcall:- set/clear/rename/append fields: edit library or tools?- new sublibrary based on aux file: library tools export?- how to improve telemetry collection?

|| the tooltip is unchanged since the earlier button as we thought it was well formulated and descriptive || im really not sure what would be the best solution on one hand it shows now symbols to the left and to the right and its hard to guess what means what on the other hand it really should stand out if there is an autolinked file guess there is no right solutionwhat if there are more than one linked files listed?
