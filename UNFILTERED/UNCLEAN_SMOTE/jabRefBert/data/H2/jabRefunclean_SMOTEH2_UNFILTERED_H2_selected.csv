11,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,BugFix for bug "#880 PubMed Import broken" Found bug: PubMed/Medline PLAIN format recognized as RIS format. Provided solution:     - Modified RIS ImportFilter. Now RIS format is identified by looking for the "TY" tag (it is a mandatory tag in RIS format and it is not conflictual with other filters)     - Added new ImportFilter "MedlinePlain". This import filter parses Medline files in plain format (not XML). The import filter has been produced referring to the official Medline documentation (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html)     - Updated the net.sf.jabref.core plugin.xml file in order to include the newly added MedlinePlain import filter

175,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,Increase saving speed Intended to fix #122  this PR turned into a major API change. It replaces `String[]` in the return types of `BibtexEntryType` with `List<String>`. This allows to return immutable lists instead of mutable arrays and improves the stability of the program. Additionally  the rewrite allowed to replace a lot of duplicate object creation with instance variables.  With respect to #122  the immutability of the new lists removes the necessity to create defensive copies and therefore avoids a lot of cloning.

Right now the entry type is converted from a string representation (in the bibtex file) to an EntryType by the parser. The problem with this approach is that the parser has to know about the bibtex vs biblatex mode. The idea was to just store the string in the BibEntry and only get the corresponding EntryType whenever it is really necessary.

Actually  as the tests reveal it was not a problem with the actual parser but within the file opening logic.

This should follow the convention for entries. - There is no space anymore between `@String` and the bracket and after the bracket  i.e. `@String{name  {string}}` instead of `@String { name  {string} }` - Implemented [#756](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/756): Add possibility to reformat all entries on save (under Preferences  File)  Refactorings: - Renamed FileActions to BibDatabaseWriter - Merged code for export and save in BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted SaveSettings class from FileActions to own file and extended it (& renamed to SavePreferences). Note that this class has some setters (against the recently established convention for preference classes) since there are quite a few cases where the values from the preferences have to be overriden.  - Change usage of arrays to list in many places - Remove unused boolean parameters checkSearch  checkGroup - Moved writing of metadata and CustomEntryTypesManager to BibDatabaseWriter - Extracted and reused gui code for displaying and editing sort preferences (SaveOrderConfigDisplay)

The whole PDFImporter class is screwed and a monkeypatch. It should be reimplemented from scratch.
947,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,[WIP] Fix for undoing deletion/cutting multiple entries Workaround for #796. When an undo with multiple entries is undone  each entry is undone one at a time. The Problem herein lies  that when the first entry is undone  the insertion in the database triggers the creation and insertion of an NamedCompund into the UndoManager which kills the main Undo (the one with the multiple entries)  which result in just one entry being undone.  With this Workaround each entry has its own NamedCompund which solves the Problem but the user has to call the UndoAction several times (Ctrl-Z for each entry). - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described? - [x] Changes in pull request outlined?

Also see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-8/+bug/1510009  **Especially see** https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug813143  Maybe we can just ignore this and wait for it to be fixed in OpenJDK and add a hint to our FAQ and documentation?

This causes a lot of issues. I do not think that JabRef should still support such strange logic  and just use the value which is in the year field.   Hence  I removed it.   This also solves the issue of having that YearUtil in the model package which duplicated a method in the StringUtil class.   Refs #1163

Moreover  #1080 and #1153 are fixed.  In detail  the following things were changed: - The abstract `ImportFormat` class is almost completely rewritten. Please have a look at this class. Almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the ImportFormat class. The biggest change is that the import method returns a `ParserResult` instead of a list of entries (in this way  metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing IOExceptions). Moreover  the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers. -  Add method `importDatabase(Path file  Charset encoding)` to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method. - The BibTexImporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from `OpenDatabaseAction.loadDatabase` to determine the encoding of the bib file. - Change OpenDatabaseAction to operate against the BibTex importer.  - Remove get/set isCustomImporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical) - Empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)  Remark: The methods getExtension and getDescription are not implemented by almost any importer. This should be done. Maybe this is something for the stupro?

1471,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,Preserve user comments in bib file So I am finally having my take at #1026. The current solution was surprisingly easy so far (despite what I had written before). It looks explicitly for our encoding prefix in the file ("Encoding: ") and kills lines that contain it (but only lines preceding an entry  it will not delete something that is inside an entry). Other user comments are left untouched and are _always_ written out again  even if the entry is reformatted.  User comments that are above meta data  bibtex strings  or the preamble will still be removed  though. Changing that would require large scale changes to these items in our model  since we would also need to store the parsed serialization for them  which we do not do so far.  This should receive significant automated  but also manual  testing  since it modifies a quite critical part and has the potential to destroy bib files.

1483,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Fixes #1482: Correct number of matched entries is displayed for refining subgroups The issue was that  for the number of hits  JabRef only checked if the group taken separately matched the entry. That is  it was completely ignored that the group sits in a tree and might be set up to refine the search of the parent. Taking the example given in #1482  577 entries satisfy the condition `articlé original` but only 38 are also matched by `articlé`. - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes)

However  determining from the complete parsed serialization where the entry begins and what are comments before the entry is not so trivial. Thus  I added another attribute in the bibentry `commentsBeforeEntry` in which the serialized form of the comments stored in front of the entry is directly saved during parsing the entry.

I figured out that the problem is that the `KeyEvent` returns localized key texts so you can not use this to set the `KeyBindings`(the JabRef `KeyBindings` use English key texts). At the moment I only see two possibilities that do not end up in comparing tons of Strings to manually get the english localization.   ~~First would be to change the locale to English  so that the `KeyEvent` returns english key texts  but I do not know what I might break with that and if the rest of the localization will still work.~~   ~~Second solution would be to change the `KeyBindings` so that they use `KeyCodes` instead of Strings. This would IMHO improve the `KeyBindings` system but it would mean a lot of changes in all the `KeyBinding` related code.~~ See the comment below for my approach https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1815#issuecomment-242346564. - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef

2162,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,Specialfields refactoring Rewrite of #1964   This kept bugging me  so I invested some time in it. It integrates the changes from #1964 and turns the different special fields into enum values. The different classes composing special fields are now aligned to our architecture. The enum `SpecialField` has to go to `logic` as it involves quite some localization.  There are still some possible improvements based on this PR  in particular: - Outsourcing localization from `SpecialField` so that this class can be moved into `model` (this is not necessarily needed  though) - Rewriting `SpecialFieldsUtil`  which is already marked as deprecated.  To maintain a reasonable scope for this PR  these improvements should be done in separate new PRs. They should now also be much simpler based on the new structure. - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef

When using required fields only  this works perfectly. When in biblatex mode  JabRef does not display the value of `journal` in the required fields  because JabRef demands the field `journaltitle`. This is not only confusing for me  but also for other users: #2209.  I know that a clean solution is #521. This  however  wont happen this year.  I also know that a bibtex-to-biblatex converter and biblatex-to-bibtex converter is another solution. This  however  forces users to run these when copying and pasting between databases. This could be solved by running these converters silently when copying and pasting. When JabRef is used in parallel to other software (such as Notepad++)  this does not help. I cannot force everyone to use JabRef. Thus  simply supporting `journal` in JabRef is the solution for me.   The biblatex manual states:  > journal field (literal) > An alias for journaltitle  provided for BibTeX compatibility. See § 2.2.2.

2396,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,[WIP] Introduce explicit list of ALL_BIBLATEX_ONLY_FIELDS This fixes #2390. The last implementation used `EntryConverter.FIELD_ALIASES_LTX_TO_TEX`. This implementation is based on `BibtexEntryTypes` and `BiblatexEntryTypes`.   ## Issue `JabRefPreferences.CUSTOM_TAB_NAME_num_` should be used to really determine the fields to check. This  however  is really a **huge** architectural rework.  It has to be checked  in following (seldom) situation:  - Field X is defined in JabRefs BiblatexEntryTypes - Field X is added by the user to a general tab  JabRef now complains that X is Biblatex only.  ## Further changes  * ISBN and ISBN are now BibTeX fields  too.    - Reason: Even though  both are not listed in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) and the [lncs style](ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/splncs03.bst)  I see them so hard tied to a book and article  that I would add it. In the case of a DOI  JabRef (more or less) enforces it by offering that field in the "General" tab. Moreover  [it is part of plainnat.bst](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/52046/9075) and [natbib](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/natbib) is a popular package.  * `FieldName.COMMENT` instead of `FieldName.COMMENTS` (affects OaiImporter only)  * Preferences: Use FieldName constants at `setLanguageDependentDefaultValues()`  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [n/a] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [n/a] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [n/a] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?

This was really hard to track down. It was not a problem in our conversion maps  but in `LatexToUnicode`. The ultimate reason is that this code is just an utter mess of hacks and I could only fix this by adding another ugly map on top of this heap.  We have already identified this class to cause performance issues and  as you can see here  it is very difficult to maintain. We should consider removing the functionality and rewriting it from scratch or (preferably) replace it with an external library. After all  converting a LaTeX string to Unicode seems sufficiently well-defined that there is some library for this out there.  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [X] Tests created for changes - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef

The problem was that the old group with legacy bib references ```` ExplicitGroup:StaticGroup\ 0\ 1137631\ 1233448\ 1314293\   ```` otherwise couldnt be distinguished from a new explicit group with icon and color:  ```` StaticGroup:StaticGroup\ 0\ expansion\ icon\ color\ description\   ```` I think we really should switch to https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/232 at some point.  -----  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?

This is not actually correct according to the rules of LaTeX  but seems to be an important exception required by our users.  This is achieved by the following:  1. Replace all single underscores with `JABREFUNDERSCORE`  2. Do the unicode conversion  3. Replace `JABREFUNDERSCORE` with an underscore  TODO: We should find a better magic word instead of `JABREFUNDERSCORE`  because every character will be processed by latex2unicode and that costs performance. However  it should still be long and unique enough so that we avoid accidental conversions.

2995,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Less backups Addresses #2993  The frequent events are due to the bidirectional binding which transfers every change directly into the BibEntry. If we want fewer events  the only solution will probably be to break the binding  which would be very disappointing for the JavaFX implementation. In my point of view the problem is not on the side of event creation. After all  every change should trigger an event and JavaFX triggers many changes. Imho  this should be fixed in how we react to events.  I also noticed the exception  but do not get a dialog. This seems to happen because of the save operation invoked by the backup.  A solution might be to do less backups  by:  1. Doing backups only every X events and not for every event  2. Ignoring FieldChangeEvents in the Backup  3. Adding the size of the field change in the FieldChangeEvent class  so that you can ignore it if only 1 character changed.  This PR combines options 1. and 3.  i.e.: The backup manager ignores events that are very minor and only does a backup if enough of them have happened (currently set to five).

In detail  when `EntryEditor` opens up  it is not focused automatically. The desired behavior is to focus the first `Textfield` on any of the `EntryEditor`s tabs.  The way the fix is implemented: when `EntryEditor` is opened  the `JFXPanel` in which is the `TabPane` of the `EntryEditor` is getting the focus  The focus is given implicitly to a focusTraversable node contained in the `JFXPanel`. The selection of the node seems to be "random" (even though consistent for a given tree of nodes). As far as Ive tested it consistently focuses the first `Textfield` on any tab  which is the desired behavior. I make this pull requested as suggested in #3052 discussion by @Siedlerchr .  I should mention that I ran `gradle check` which results in "6 tests failed" in my setup but this was also the result when I ran the test before making any change.  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?

For some reason  I did not manage to get this working when the source tab takes care of deregistration. Therefore  I moved all event handling out of the source tab and into the entry editor.  Using jvisualvm  I can see that garbage collection works with this PR. Cycling through the main table with the entry editor open increases used RAM. When you force garbage collection  the used heap goes down to close to zero again  instead of staying at a higher plateau. See attached screenshot  ![heap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1515701/29381572-f60537f6-82c9-11e7-9ad9-20e6208ca648.png)  So this fixes the memory leak.

On top of that  I found the the source tab isnt integrated in the undo framework at all  so I have added this as well. However  it does not work problem-free. It seems that the FX CodeArea consumes undo events as well. So when you hit undo in the sourcetab  the CodeArea does the undo and then the UndoManager tries to do it again and fails. It has no consequence  though  apart from an exception  the undo happens anyway.  Since this is an improvement (add undo to source tab again)  I would like to merge this even if its not perfect. I have zero time to dig deeper into these FX problems  and I assume that no one else will do it. So  we can just merge the current state.   - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?

3443,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Fix for issue #3381 Because the javafx Tooltip used in the [GlobalSearchBar](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/search/GlobalSearchBar.java) cannot render HTML  @tobiasdiez recommended in #3381  to create a TextFlow object in the [SearchDescriber](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/rules/describer/SearchDescriber.java) classes for structuring the Text.   I made the changes to return a TextFlow and its working fine so far without changing the logic that is used to build the text.  I moved the search.rules.describer package like proposed from the logic package to the gui package. The existing tests were moved accordingly but still needs to be rewritten for the new TextFlow results.  There are some open questions i would like to ask:  1. With no Styling of the Tooltip  the readability was really bad (black text on grey background)  so I changed the styling to look like the other Tooltips in the bar. Hope it was okay to do this in the context of this issue? I created a new styleclass for this in the Main.css to not change any other styled elements. 2. the [SearchQuery](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/search/SearchQuery.java) class stores a description of the search. It is created with the SearchDescribers. But they are now inside the gui package and return a TextFlow. So there is a javafx dependency in the SearchQuery class which resides in the logic package at the moment. This doesnt sound right to me? Should the class be moved to the gui package too? 3. The [GroupDialog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/groups/GroupDialog.java) class uses a SearchQuery object to get a search description. This class is written with Swing and is not compatible to the now returned TextFlow. If I understand it right  the project is migrating to use javaFX. So I want to propose that I write a compatibility method in the GroupDialog class to create an HTML string from the given TextFlow to be compatible while the GroupDialog is still using Swing.  4. Sadly the localized strings used in the SearchDescribers included the HTML tag elements.. So in many cases it is not possible to use existing translations.. just because the tags are gone. Im not sure what to do about this. It could be possible to remove the tags manually from the translations. Not sure how long this would take..  Thats how the tooltip looks with the changes: ![screenshot-2017-11-18--13 15 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4948016/32980197-9c017e62-cc62-11e7-86a6-b5c0c0010ac8.png)  There seems to be something wrong with the logic of the tooltip text creation  the first few words repeat itself. And it already happened prior to my changes (see the image in #3381) But I didnt had time to look very closely into this. Should I open a new issue for this problem?  I hope I didnt forget anything. Im happy to hear your feedback!  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [x] If you changed the localization: Did you run `gradle localizationUpdate`?
3444,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,Implements #1664: group based on aux file <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ... -->  This PR implements #1664 by adding a group that contains all entries referenced in a given aux-file. So far the code is only a prototype  but it already works really well. What is missing is that changes in the aux file are automatically recognized and handled (this should be easy to accomplish). The user interface is very very basic and only contains a text field where the user can specify the path to the aux file (in light of the upcoming rewrite of the groups dialog in javafx #2643  I do not want to spent to much time at ui stuff).   I have two questions: - ~~The implementation so far is against our architecture. The new group (`TexGroup`) is in the model but uses the `AuxParser` from the logic. Any ideas how to resolve this issue?

So far the code is only a prototype  but it already works really well. What is missing is that changes in the aux file are automatically recognized and handled (this should be easy to accomplish). The user interface is very very basic and only contains a text field where the user can specify the path to the aux file (in light of the upcoming rewrite of the groups dialog in javafx #2643  I do not want to spent to much time at ui stuff).   I have two questions: - ~~The implementation so far is against our architecture. The new group (`TexGroup`) is in the model but uses the `AuxParser` from the logic. Any ideas how to resolve this issue?

3454,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Replace swingx with standard swing In order to be able to properly move to Java 9 (see #2594)  we need to get rid of all accesses of internal APIs. Unfortunately  we also use libraries that make such internal accesses and we need to find a solution for that.  One of these libraries is swingx. Originally by Sun  it is no longer maintained since quite a while we could not even upgrade to the newest version  because of bugs in the library. It is time to get rid of this dependency. This PR replaces the usage of swingx with regular Swing components. Only the new entries dialog and the side pane are affected. For the new entries dialog  the change is trivial (just using a regular layout manager). For the side pane  a few changes are needed  but I can make it roughly resemble the old layout.   Theres one bigger change  though  that I happen to like very much: The side panes are no longer exclusive  you can display them together. That means that I can have the web search and the groups panel open at the same time. Personally  I think thats pretty cool and I would like to keep it that way. You can of course still disable the side panes independent of each other.

The auto-link algorithm just checked if the file starts with the BibTeX key.

This is fixed in this PR. With the proposed implementation also the pdf file "Einstein1902aboutSomething.pdf" is no longer found (since there is really no possibility in telling the difference to "Einstein1902a - a second paper.pdf").

3661,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Export no empty lines in RIS format This fixes the remaining part of #3634  I had a closer look at the export / layout logic and wow  this is arcane! The code is more than 12 years old and almost as bad as the bibtex parser used to be.  This PR is based on two decisions:  - I do not want to change the old layouting code. If I do  I am almost guaranteed to break it in many ways. - I do not know if the removal of empty lines in exported text is really desirable in all cases. Maybe users wrote their custom formatters to explicitly include empty lines? I cannot tell.  We now have one case (RIS export) where empty lines are not desired. So  I implemented a solution that only changes the behavior of the RIS export  but leaves all others untouched. Nonetheless  it is very easy (single constructor parameter) to let other formats use empty line elimination as well.   The empty line elimination is done using a hardly understandable  but fully functional regex.   ----  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

This is tracked here: #3645 I think this is a huge problem  because we are missing out on a lot of validation here.   This PR is a migration of the paramterized RIS tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. Id like to put this forward to discussion  so that we can agree on how our parameterized JUnit 5 tests are to look like. When we have agreed  we can migrate all tests.

3690,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,[WIP] File link deletion dialog improvements This pull request fixes the following issues:  * When a file link in a bibliography entry is deleted by the user  a dialog is displayed. Previously  the default (first) dialog option deleted the linked file from disk. The default behaviour has been changed to just removing the file link from the entry.    This is a fix to issue #3679  Fixes #3679   * When clicking the "Cancel" button in the file link deletion dialog  the file  was being deleted from the list. This behaviour has been fixed by changing the return value of the `delete()` method when the "Cancel" button is chosen.  ## Example screenshot:  ![2018-02-04-001057_477x142_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20418176/35773368-0191977e-0950-11e8-90cb-ba778105f3e3.png)  ## Checklist:  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Screenshots added - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)  ---  I am unsure whether the remaining checklist items are applicable to this pull request.

Ive added statement that checks authors  titles and chapters of two inbooks. What do you think?  I have several questions: 1. Im not sure about using `compareSingleField` function for comparing chapters  because sometimes they are very similar  but different  for instance: chapter 1 and chapter 2. Any idea? My is to remove chapter word from strings and then make the comparison.  2. Should I also add test for incollections? 3. What about pages? As I noticed they can be a replacement for chapters. Should I consider them in the code? 4. Can I add another commits with some cleanup and refactor for the files Ive touched? I mean adding some finals to make code less error prone etc.

Following the DiVA ID type classes as template  an RFC fetcher class and fetcher test has been added. I added RFC to the ID-based entry generator list within WebFetchers so it is an option in the dialogs dropdown.  Currently  the RFC fetcher class accepts search requests with or without the "rfc" prefix--is this an okay feature?

Test text:  <img src"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/test-selection.png" width300/>  Test result:  <img src"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/20180802201505.png"/>  There is another problem with the regular expression `(\r?\n|\r)` when I try to use `(?<![.|:])(\r?\n|\r)` for excluding the new line end with `.` or `:`.   If its on Windows  the `\r\n` will be replaced with a whitespace  and it is OK. However if we encounter `.\r\n`  the `.\r` will be reserved and the `\n` will be replaced by a whitespace. In this way  the `.\r` will not be shown as new line int the field  and we do not need this whitespace. So instead we should change `.\r\n` to `\r\n` directly.  So I use javas `%n` to distinguish new line wisely.  # Font size of summary on the left changed to 10px  # Summary text wrapped  # The Final example:  <img src"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upupming/paste/master/img/changed-file-notation.png"/>   <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...

Set auto cleanup url links on paste action and add cleanup url menu item to the url field Most codes are modified from a previous contributor in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3394.  Currently the menu item list changed as follows(with defalut editor menu  change case  convert  etc): ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36831746/43885542-c2fe8826-9beb-11e8-9814-250861513426.png) But I am not sure whether its necessary to add defalut editor menu. If not the menu item list would be: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36831746/43885580-e411765e-9beb-11e8-99b2-6a8756bf0cd1.png)   I have run `./gradlew check` but failed. But even if I switch to the master branch which is the same as JabRef/master  the build still failed with the same error message like: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36831746/43886264-c4c4b8d6-9bed-11e8-9126-e3a0a3ac82d6.png) But it seems that I did not modify related classes.

Link issues by using the following pattern: [#333](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/333) or [koppor#49](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47).      The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Hi  Im trying to fix the issue #3959   and I have some problems here. Can someone help me?  **1. Some tests do not seem to have a parameter source** Such as  `BibTeXMLExporterTest.java`  `MSBibExportFormatTestFiles.java`  `ModsExportFormatTestFiles.java`  and so on. Since I cant get feedback from both Travis CI and my IDE  I couldnt do anything at the moment. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997706-ee482a88-9e15-11e8-9b43-9b9f9853c150.png)   **2. Something about the external libraries** For `MainArchitectureTestsWithArchUnit.java`   `testCompile com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.8.3` **isnt enough for migrate this test to JUnit 5.** Just a few days ago  `ArchUnit` just supported tests with only JUnit 5 package. But this feature needs a `testCompile com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit:0.9.0` and as far as I know  this version has not been released yet. For `CiteKeyBasedFileFinderTest.java`  I havent found an extension in JUnit 5 for the `MockitoJUnitRunner.class` in JUnit 4. And it seems that their (mock) official version hasnt been release yet  too.   **3. The Database Test** As I can see  those tests have already been migrated partly to JUnit 5. But the rest of it is the PROBLEM. Ive tried to migrate `DBMSProcessorTest.java`   but the code is no longer concise after that. For example   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997780-26078368-9e18-11e8-9fce-43d293fedf88.png) this is the old version  and ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997784-3e0ae356-9e18-11e8-8073-d43eeb12f0d5.png) that is the new version. And that is only part of it. The reason is that I couldnt pass the parameters to the `@BeforeEach` method in JUnit 5  but JUnit 4 can use those local variable to pass the parameters. I think this is where the difference occurred.   **4. The GUI Test** I just change the `@Category` annotation to `@Tag` annotation  as I have known that those tests are mostly obsolete.   **5. About CleanupWorkerTest** This test is not hard to migrate from JUnit 4 to 5. But when I finish  and run the tests on my IDE  two tests failed. And the error message is quite weird. It seems that the worker does not work in JUnit 5 tests. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25541992/43997847-be8c685a-9e19-11e8-9c3a-a911d9daeafe.png)   And if there are any errors or something can be improved in other tests that I didnt mention  please let me know!

Getting the original field 2. Check for corporate author (braces start and end) 3. get latex free value 4. Readd braces for corporate  5. Parse author  The only edgecase which can occur if the entry starts with an author in latex braces and ends with an author in latex braces.

The `getFilePath()` of TexGroup now returns the relative path of the aux file used to create the group. 4. Each user can define their own `LaTexFileDirectory` similar to `userFileDirectory` 5. I have implemented tests to check for basic parsing/serialization and also to check that the relative path is being found correctly. 6. When user selects an aux file via the browse button  they are shown the relative path of the file in `texGroupFilePath` in Group Dialog.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The main cause for this issue was in the Linux implementation of NativeDesktop(Linux.java#openFolderAndSelectFile)  that code looks for  an environment variable named DESKTOP_SESSION and if this variable is not set in any system then it will result in Null Pointer Exception.  The Fix was to check if DESKTOP_SESSION variable is present or not  if not present then run a default command which will try to open the folder.  Another issue was that if a system does not have a file browser installed then right-clicking on any entry and selecting "open folder" option will not do anything(if there is no file browser installed in the system).  To fix this issue Ive added an option in preference setting window to set command or program for default file browser  where a user can explicitly set command or let JefRef use a default behavior like this:  ![jabref-fix-4763](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17297948/54761987-39418780-4c19-11e9-999e-2b62fa24b237.png)  ----  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

5025,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,Add warning for empty BibTeX keys in entry editor Added a warning for empty BibTeX keys in entry editor.  Fixes #4440   A request came in to have the entry editor provide a warning when the BibTeX key field is empty. In order to make the warning icon appear  2 changes were necessary.  **1 - Added new key value pair to multi map in FieldCheckers:** To check for a valid BibTex key in the entry editor  the FieldCheckers object had the following key - value pair in its multimap  ( FieldName.KEY  ValidBibtexKeyChecker object )  where FieldName.KEY is the string "key".  When the BibtexKeyEditorViewModel tries to actually run this check  they key it provides to the FieldCheckers instance is BibEntry.KEY_FIELD ("bibtexkey") instead of FieldName.KEY ("key"). To accommodate for this  BibEntry.KEY_FIELD was added to the FieldCheckers multimap.   **2 - Added null and empty string check in ValidBibtexKeyChecker.checkValue():** Fixing the first issue caused an error to come arise in BibtexKeyGenerator.cleanKey() when called by ValidBibtexKeyChecker.checkValue(). This error was due to null strings being fed into BibtexKeyGenerator.cleanKey(). To fix this  a check for null or zero length strings was added. This check also returned the "empty BibTex key" message.   **Note:** an issue with the fix is that while it does create the "empty BibTeX key" warning  the "Invalid BibTeX key" warning is pushed down. Pictures of this issue are attached.  <img width"436" alt"warningIcon1" src"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38050737/58768790-6641dd00-856e-11e9-96da-f51c6c79c2a1.png">  <img width"420" alt"warningIcon2" src"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38050737/58768794-71950880-856e-11e9-8364-929ece03ec50.png">   ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

I took the liberty  to add a split-pane between the conents and the tabList to enable the user to change the width between them  so this PR is not just about refactoring the Dialog.  -)  This is very early shot on this matter. I do not know if you think its worth moving on with this and to look also into the tabs.  <img width"427" alt"preferenceDialog" src"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/58988728-985b7500-87e2-11e9-9664-4fcc8a1410e5.png">  Tabs to convert to MVVM - [x] General - [x] File  The following conversions will be done in other PRs  as this one would grow too large. - [x] Entry table #5315 - [x] Entry table columns #5185 - [x] External programs #5047 - [x] Entry preview #5062 - [x] Groups #5141 - [x] Entry editor #5315 - [x] BibTeX key generator #5360 - [x] Import #5315 - [x] Export sorting #5315 - [x] Name formatter #5265 - [x] XMP metadata #5265 - [x] Network #5141 - [x] Advanced #5141 - [x] Appereance #5360  After conversion of the tabs - [x] Code cleanup  simplification  refactoring - [ ] Reordering the preferences  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

When importing RIS files Jabref checks for date fields (Y1 PY DA and Y2) and uses the first one it finds. The problem is that Y2 refers to access date  DA in most cases is a generic date  and PY is the publication year(reliable field)*.  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/40600b35420e688ee5d5758224717b484ad34f84/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/RisImporter.java#L196-L203 We couldnt find references to Y1(primary date?). However  as already cited in [#4816](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4816)  and by doing some exports we found Y1 to be  PYs synonym  furthermore  when PY received a higher priority than Y1  some tests cases didnt pass as there were a missing month field in .bib.    We established a priority system indicated by the dateTags (lowest index higher priority)  https://github.com/VMichelan/jabref/blob/2f243c16f08f2cfeba6f1ab4651970d90eb55546/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/importer/fileformat/RisImporter.java#L31  We added 2 test cases for this and changed one of the old ones adding the month field.  *https://web.archive.org/web/20120717122530/http://refman.com/support/direct%20export.zip ** nicely displayed in: https://github.com/aurimasv/translators/wiki/RIS-Tag-Map  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  ### What this PR adds? This PR is related to [koppor#343](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/343).  I added a field formatter called **Shorten DOI** formatter which shortens DOI using http://shortdoi.org service. You run the formatter from _Cleanup entries dialog_ by adding it to _Run field formatter_ list.  It looks to work fine. It enables one way conversion from DOI to short DOI.  ### Implementation details: I assumed that short DOI is still a legal DOI. Thats why I adjusted the DOI class to work with short DOIs.  ### Feedback wanted I Id like to ask for your feedback about the code at this stage.  ### Next step - Add a more accessible UI - a toggle button next to the DOI field _shortened/long version_ (This was suggested by @koppor)  This will require adding opposite conversion (from short DOI to DOI). As http://shortdoi.org servcie does not offer such a feature I see two approaches:  1. Store the original DOI during the conversion for further back conversion. **Drawback:** You may not convert from short DOI to DOI if you havent done the opposite conversion for at least one time. 2. Try to obtain DOI from short DOI using https://doi.org service as it is possible by catching the HTTP redirection  I find the 1st approach fine. The 2th approach is not really good as we are not using any public API and this can stop working in the future.  What do you think folks? :)  ### Important If you would like to checkout this branch and test locally please use [shortdoi-workaround](https://github.com/dawidowoc/jabref/tree/shortdoi-workaround) branch which uses workaround by @r0light for issue [#5245](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5245).

So it is possible to paste it in a text editor  doing click in the middle/third mouse button.  ![copy_version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12954316/67137766-aca48980-f23a-11e9-9bf0-a96ee1ef920f.gif)  - It is necessary to call the `install()` method in every text field where you want to use it. For the moment  it is activated in the `GlobalSearchBar`  therefore you can try it: write something  select a piece of text and do click in the middle button.  ![global_search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12954316/67137765-ab735c80-f23a-11e9-8f17-2015c9833a20.gif)  - Now `ClipBoardManager` uses the singleton pattern.

The tests pass  but can anyone think of a problem with that approach?  As it is my first PR to this project  any suggestions are highly appreciated.

This JabRef extension is developed as part of a software engineering course.  Even though we write this feature mainly for our university course  we are willing to adjust our feature  so that JabRef can benefit from it.  The feature is now ready for review. It reintroduces the possibility to extract references from plain text using a custom GROBID server. This is implemented via a new SearchBasedFetcher.  One could work some more on the GROBID server (See : https://github.com/NikodemKch/grobid/commit/e89810bd82b1b39cfcf82150d37b2200ac510a30)  but sadly we do not have time for that.  ----  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [x] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message)

Setting `setResizableWithParent` before initial layouting was finished resulted in JavaFx assuming a wrong fixed width. I changed that by adding the code to a run later block.  It works good for me on Mac. Are there any concerns with that?

5665,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,Improve change scanner If a file is changed externally  JabRef is doing a 3-way merge between the last saved value vs current value in JabRef vs new value in file. The way this is done is by first comparing the last saved file with the current (changed) file  and then trying to find additional/other changes in the currently open database. This is really complex and I believe there is some subtle bug in the logic leading to #5257.  With this PR  the change scanner is changed to a to simple 2-way merge between the current value in JabRef vs new value in file. This is way simpler and I hope this PR fixes #5257. In a few edge cases  the 2-way merge has a small disadvantage. For example  consider the following steps: - User A opens file - User A changes field `Author` to `User A` and adds field `Title` with value `new` - User B opens file - User B changes field `Author` to `User B` - User B saves file  At this point  User A gets a message that the file changed with the following changes: - field `Author` changed from `User A` to `User B` - field `Title` was removed  The 3-way merge could detect that `Title` was newly added  and thus could automatically reapply this change.  This is no longer possible with the simple 2-way merge.  <!--  Describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...  Link issues by using the following pattern: #333.

5781,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,Fix GUI tests Fixes #5602  refs #2768.  Wanted to know why our GUI tests are broken. The reason seems to be that we do not pass the preferences objects directly around  but use `Globals.prefs` at more places. Currently  the issue is in `MainTable.java`:  ```java         importHandler  new ImportHandler(                 frame.getDialogService()  database  externalFileTypes                  Globals.prefs.getFilePreferences()                  Globals.prefs.getImportFormatPreferences()                  Globals.prefs.getUpdateFieldPreferences()                  Globals.getFileUpdateMonitor()                  undoManager                  Globals.stateManager)  ```  I would propose to convert the constructor of `MainTable` (and `BasePanel`) to a builder pattern (because we have more than three arguments) and add passing of these preferences.  Alternatively  we can mock `Globals.prefs.GetFilePreferences()` etc. This is also OK for me as I accept global objects. However  we had a long discussion that we should get rid off `Globals`.  Is https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1579 the right issue  where we discussed `Globals.prefs`? I think  the comment at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1593#discussion_r71328057 summarizes the discussion.

Still some problems and things to talk about.  The most obvious one is: GroupDescription. I really do not know what to do with this. Personally I think  this description stuff shuld go into the help page. Its a wild mesh-up of error messages  validation messages for the regex and some hints about the group...  The next thing are the different group types. @MartinKarim supposed to merge most of them  as they mostly intersect each other. But if we do this  we need to provide migrations for the old groups too. This would probably go far beyond this PR.  Screenshot below  The old labels of the checkboxes a displayed as a tooltip now. But they should be better placed in the help page.  I have some problems with the validators. Somehow if i bind the disableProperty of the ok button to validProperty of the validator  Java throws a NPE. If I do not get this working  I need to think about a workaround.  I need to stop procrastinating now and get back to studying.  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

6151,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,ActionHelper to test for present file This PR fixes koppor#430  It took a little bit more refactoring than expected  for it does not only check  if StandardField.FILE has text inside  but if the file is also really present in the file system. There are some design decisions im unsure of: There is no alert about that no file is really present. The menu entry is just disabled  although there is a file symbol in the main table (since StandardField.FILE is not empty). Feedback could be implemented in the files editor in the entry editor as validation. The other thing is that in theory at last  the table does not yet automatically update  if a file is added or removed (so no file is attached). This would require  probably an array of observables to be used as an invalidation alert. Im unsure where to start with that. However  only in theory. Pracitcally the entry is unselected automatically if I change something about the attached files in the entry editor. So nobody would notice  if this would not be implemented.   - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

6233,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,Add disable/enable calculation of items in group fixes #6042  This is my first Pull Request to a project (new Java developer).   **Add:** disable/enable calculation of items in group  I realized that GroupNodeViewModel.java class uses method "calculateNumberOfMatches" to get number of items. Looks like it uploads full database from disk every time you need to calculate No of items in group. Therefore  if you have 1 thousand groups  it will read the entire database 1 thousand times.   UI changes: - added new checkbox in Preferences/Groups - "Display quantity of items in group"  - added new property DISPLAY_GROUP_QUANTITY to JabRefPreferences.java file  - connected new checkbox with JabRefPreferences.java. I used another preferences as a sample   Logic changes: - I added link to JabRefPreferences in GroupTreeView class.  If user wants to display groups quantity  a panel with quantity will be shown. Quantity is calculated when GroupNodeViewModel class is initialized  so I decided to wrap a panel into an "if" statement.  Tests passed.

I have tested to import some format of doc  just a simple test of .docx  .pptx and .pdf format files. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31007740/78802067-f30bc180-79ef-11ea-87bc-d6859b2c77b4.png)  About the source code  I have a question:  I found the wrong icon still shows in the General -> Files list  which only shows pdf icon no matter what format of files attached. Then I found org.jabref.gui.fieldeditors.LinkedFileViewModel#getTypeIcon() which directly indicate the icon to pdf  which seems like the source of the bug. There is a TODO comment above  which seems like this bug has already discovered. Then I went through the issue list and tried to find some relevant thing to this bug (TODO)  but nothing found.

Thanks @tobiasdiez 😜 : Node.lookup did not work  as the textfield node was not present at the time a edit cell was created.  Good news is: I found a way to bypass the restrictions of the private textfield variable  bad news is  its a bit of a hack  but hopefully somewhat leightweight. ~Also changes in tables should now be commited  if the focus is lost.~ Temporarily removed again  since there are deeper issues with the CellFactory.  Im still working on some minor issues. Especially the validation in tablecells is completly dysfunctional.  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50491877/79221111-85c7b880-7e55-11ea-87f2-e3a8e7545c86.png)  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

6635,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Change "duplicates" window to recall size/position The "Possible duplicate entries" window now remembers its size and position throughout a session ([#6582](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6582)). This was done by adding a DialogWindowState class to the gui utils. This class stores the size and position of the dialog window. The StateManager class was modified to store this object. It is retrieved whenever a new DuplicateResolverDialog object is created to get the previous size and position and is updated whenever the user proceeds through the dialog options. The DialogWindowState class can be re-used if this feature is needed for other dialog windows.  This is my first ever pull request so please let me know what you think or whether I need to re-tool my approach to be more in line with the structure of the rest of the code! I did not include any screenshots as this felt like a sort of awkward fix to try and take screenshots of.  - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

The issue is that `AuthorList#fixAuthorForAlphabetization` is used to create a `String` representation of authors names. This can leave unbalanced brackets if a name piece starts with a latex command  as it is not the intended use of the method.  The suggested fix is to resolve latex in the name of an author and then remove any illegal characters in the post-processing (which is dependent on if it is going to be used as a file path or citation key). As Unicode characters are already allowed in the name of an author  this change should not affect users too much. It will  however  * have slower performance  as all authors are being processed as if they contain latex * **in almost all cases that contain latex  it will produce different output than the previous solution**  **As always  these are only suggestions. Any comments and criticism are encouraged!** The "intuition" behind the suggestion is that latex in Strings will always be hard to deal with  and I think most users expect a pattern to resolve to something as similar as possible to what is shown in the main table.  **What remains** - [x] verify that the `CitationKeyGenerator` does not output Unicode keys - [x] ~remove the `latex_to_unicode` modifier as it should not be used~ - [x] change access modifiers for methods in `BracketedPattern`  Id suggest that most should be private or protected - [x] ~change how arguments are parsed for `auth.../ed...` patterns (readability)~ - [x] add test cases for this issue - [x] test for character classes in regexp - [ ] Fix parsing of bracketed patterns - [ ] Fix the conversion of unicode to characters allowed in bibtex keys in `CitationKeyGenerator`  <!--  - Go through the list below.

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Fixes #6583 . Some unicode characters can be encoded in multiple ways  and the mapping that `StringUtil#replaceSpecialCharacters` relies on does not contain all cases. The proposed solution uses [NFC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Normalizer.Form.html#NFC) to re-encode the characters so that these characters can be found. There exists more information on [Unicode normalization in the Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Normalizer.Form.html#NFC).  My subjective opinion is that most people expect Unicode to work similar to NFC  i.e.  if characters looks the same  it is likely that they are equivalent. Hence  if someone debugs issues in the `UNICODE_CHAR_MAP`  they will expect NFC. A more holistic approach should likely start with the [compatibility equivalence](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Compatibility_Equivalence_Figure)  which will require larger changes  and there does not seem to be any bugs/issues that requires these larger changes.  <!--  - Go through the list below.

6976,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,Fix "irregularly losing ability to edit data in biblatex source tab" Fixes #6936 is about the source tab (BibTeX source) losing the ability to be editable (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6936#issuecomment-703110024). This happens because `codeArea` can be disabled  but there is no code path that re-enables it.  This patch re-enables `codeArea` as editable if the BibTeX entrys source code is correct. Although the source tab cannot be used by the user to fix any syntax error in BibTeX fields (source tab will be disabled if there are syntactic errors introduced by editing the fields in the other tabs)  such error can be fixed by editing the field  which will trigger `SourceTab`s listener and call the `updateCodeArea()` method  which will enable codeArea if the source of the BibTeX entry is syntactically correct.   <!--  - Go through the list below.

7026,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,Improve error handling on GROBID server connection issues Hi   This PR relates to issues #6517 and #6891. Its more improvement than an actual fix because the root cause is: the server is not available (which I cant fix).  Motivation: When I read #6517 and #6891  I realized  that these were reported by power users  means people who e.g. understand how to activate debug logging.  When I tried to reproduce the issues  I realized  that for the end-users the issue is not transparent.  Additionally  on my OSX  the Java 14 runtime has an infinite connect timeout set  so I never got a visual response on my action (refers to "New entry from plain text" button)  What I changed: * add a property connectTimeout to URLDownloader    * this avoids the situation  where e.g. on similar setups than mine (Java 14.0.2 on OSX)  theres an infinite default connectTimeout and I never saw any error in UI nor log.    * set the default connectTimeout to 30 seconds. Which is e.g. the same order of magnitude as in many other tools and thus should have no side effects to other usages of this class    * set the connectTimeout for GROBID server to 5 seconds  because this should be sufficient as I expect this is a cloud-based service - please comment  if this assumption is wrong. * refactored the GrobidServce so that IOExceptions are percolating higher in the call-stack and then can be handled in the UI * in case of error  I add a notification to the user  with an explicit message  so users have a chance to know  whats going on.. IMHO  thats more correct and easier to understand for users  over the current behavior  where just a message "0 entries parsed" occurs. (screenshot below in the comments) * added EN and DE translation for the new message.  I hope  with this new behavior  users will better understand  why this feature does not work as expected.   - [x] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [x] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes) - [x] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

7191,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Fix Short DOI error Fixes #7127   In issue #6920 the detection of exact short dois was improved. This was relevant where short dois were misplaced under the wrong field of an entry. This did not affect the method `public static Optional<DOI> findInText(String text)`  which looks for dois _within_ text (not exact matches).  With this commit  I have carried the improvements over to the _within-text_ detection. I had to make the detection more stringent  to avoid mis-detections for cases like _bla bla 10:30 bla bla_ or _bli blubb 10/12/2020 blibb blabb_ etc. Short dois within text will now only be detected if there is any _doi_ or _urn_ within the substring. E.g. any of the following will be detected:  - doi:10/12ab - /urn:doi:10/12ab - doi.org/10/1234 - doi.org/ab123 (shortcut doi) - etc..  I also introduced the concept of _shortcut dois_ to the in-text detection. (e.g. _doi.org/xyz123_)  <!--  - Go through the list below.

7210,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Updates to institution citation keys <!--  Describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...  Link issues that are fixed  e.g. "Fixes #333". If you fixed a koppor issue  link it  e.g. "Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47". The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Fixes #6942. Fixes #7199.  #### TL DR Authors only having a last name are abbreviated. #6942 is miss-abbreviated because name parts containing `uni` are assumed to be universities  e.g.  `United Airlines`. #7199 is triggers the abbreviation method because  from BibTeX´s point-of-view  the author only has a last name. The name is later removed because Java does not classify the first character as an uppercase letter  hence the heuristic assumes it is an insignificant word. E.g.  `{eBay}` gets removed  `{JabRef}` does not.  #### Background Authors that are institutions can have very lengthy citation keys unless they are abbreviated in some fashion. The abbreviations are generated in  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/6718c08cf5ace13365da2ce4c1509e4817eb34bc/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/citationkeypattern/BracketedPattern.java#L1243  which is based on a heuristic that tries to determine a suitable abbreviation based on the content of the specific author.  Issue #6942 is due to a regexp being overly broad when determining if an author is a university.  Issue #7199 was created from #6706 where I changed how a company/institute is identified. In previous versions of JabRef  an author is an institute if it is enclosed in curly brackets (e.g.  `{JabRef}`)  and I changed it to also include authors who only have a last name (e.g.  `JabRef`)  which means that the author in issue #7199 is treated as an institution. This would not have been an issue if it wasnt because the heuristic for creating a citation key identifies words starting with a lowercase letter in the authors name as an invalid part of an institute abbreviation. Think of the "and" in "National Aeronautics and Space Administration"). Since the authors name only consist of one "word"  it is removed. (this is why the workaround @tobiasdiez mentioned does not work  even if it should)  #### Changes for #6942 1. Identifying universities in the authors names is arbitrary. The new regexp matches `^uni(v|b|$).*` instead of `^uni`. There are other suggestions in #6706 that can be implemented instead. 2. The inline institute abbreviation should now work again (e.g.  `{JabRef ({JB})}` should produce `JB`) 3. I am ignoring the `shortauthor` field  because I find it unclear how and when to use the field (e.g.  for multiple authors).  #7199  1. Ill change how institutes are identified  so that the `Author` must only have a last name and that last name must contain a space.

If you fixed a koppor issue  link it  e.g. "Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47". The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Fixes #6942. Fixes #7199.  #### TL DR Authors only having a last name are abbreviated. #6942 is miss-abbreviated because name parts containing `uni` are assumed to be universities  e.g.  `United Airlines`. #7199 is triggers the abbreviation method because  from BibTeX´s point-of-view  the author only has a last name. The name is later removed because Java does not classify the first character as an uppercase letter  hence the heuristic assumes it is an insignificant word. E.g.  `{eBay}` gets removed  `{JabRef}` does not.  #### Background Authors that are institutions can have very lengthy citation keys unless they are abbreviated in some fashion. The abbreviations are generated in  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/6718c08cf5ace13365da2ce4c1509e4817eb34bc/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/citationkeypattern/BracketedPattern.java#L1243  which is based on a heuristic that tries to determine a suitable abbreviation based on the content of the specific author.  Issue #6942 is due to a regexp being overly broad when determining if an author is a university.  Issue #7199 was created from #6706 where I changed how a company/institute is identified. In previous versions of JabRef  an author is an institute if it is enclosed in curly brackets (e.g.  `{JabRef}`)  and I changed it to also include authors who only have a last name (e.g.  `JabRef`)  which means that the author in issue #7199 is treated as an institution. This would not have been an issue if it wasnt because the heuristic for creating a citation key identifies words starting with a lowercase letter in the authors name as an invalid part of an institute abbreviation. Think of the "and" in "National Aeronautics and Space Administration"). Since the authors name only consist of one "word"  it is removed. (this is why the workaround @tobiasdiez mentioned does not work  even if it should)  #### Changes for #6942 1. Identifying universities in the authors names is arbitrary. The new regexp matches `^uni(v|b|$).*` instead of `^uni`. There are other suggestions in #6706 that can be implemented instead. 2. The inline institute abbreviation should now work again (e.g.  `{JabRef ({JB})}` should produce `JB`) 3. I am ignoring the `shortauthor` field  because I find it unclear how and when to use the field (e.g.  for multiple authors).  #7199  1. Ill change how institutes are identified  so that the `Author` must only have a last name and that last name must contain a space. This should only happen if the `Author` originally were enclosed in brackets. In all other cases Id argue it is acceptable to not abbreviate the author since the name is only one word.     1. Drawbacks to this approach is that I am using the LatexToUnicodeAdapter to remove braces  and it does not like unbalanced ones.  <!--  - Go through the list below.

7292,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,Fixed exception about missing custom css file Fixes #7177 "Java Exception when trying to open the preferences with missing custom theme"  After some testing I found that there two main paths that could result in the same failure: the CSS file being missing before application start  and changing the name of the CSS file while the application is running. To resolve the latter  I think the best approach is to check the custom CSS file exists.  This is already done for the Theme as used for most of the application  however the Preview Viewer has its own CSS URL logic.  Rather than add file checking logic to the Preview Viewer  I have refactored and moved the theme logic of Preview Viewer into Theme  so that all CSS URL logic is encapsulated in that class. I have also put the logic that checks that the URL is valid and filters it to an Optional.empty() into one new method  additionalCssToLoad()  in place of the field of the same name. This ensure that the file existence check is performed in all cases  rather than just at construction of the Theme object.  I have kept the Optional<URL> field so there should be no overhead to this approach for the built in themes  and only the minor and necessary overhead of file existence checking for the custom theme.  For manual testing I checked:  - previews and overall appearance for default theme are correct  after restart - previews and overall appearance for dark theme are correct  after restart - previews and overall appearance with a custom theme with a valid name are correct  after restart - live changes to the custom theme still work  in general and for preview - rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct  **before application start**. The preview is no longer themed but there is no error. - the preview theme is restored when the filename is restored to the configured value  without restarting the application - Restart. Rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct  **while application is running**. The preview remains themed (typically sized CSS themes are data URL embedded and so survive file removal).  These tests were run both with the Gradle run task  and on the built binary (rationale: gradle presents the dark theme as a file  while the binary has it built in on a jrt: URL  so the results could be different).

Link issues that are fixed  e.g. "Fixes #333". If you fixed a koppor issue  link it  e.g. "Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47". The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> #### Fixes #4342  #4342 contains two issues. 1. The bracketed pattern `[title]` does not refer to the StandardField title  but a "special" pattern intended to give nicer output (this is why dashes do not work  see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4342#issuecomment-742722875). It is intended and can be **avoided** by using `[TITLE]`. 2. An expanded bracketed pattern is interpreted as a regexp (which it should not). This is why parenthesizes does not work. A pattern that expands into `(abc)` will match `abc`  but not `(abc)`.   If the expanded bracketed pattern contains characters that have a special meaning in regexp (such as a parenthesis and brackets)  it becomes a problem. An entry with the title `Regexp from [A-Z]` and the bracketed expression `[TITLE]` would match a file titled `Regexp from B`  but not a file named `Regexp from [A-Z]`.  #### The goal of this PR  Match files whose expanded bracketed pattern includes symbols that can be miss-interpreted.  1. **Regex**: All expanded brackets will match literally   using `Pattern.quote`. I do not see a reasonable use-case for allowing a bracket to expand into an actual regex. 2. **Cleaned filenames** _In addition_ to matching the regularly expanded brackets  they will also match cleaned file names (it will find files containing both `ACM/IEEE-CS` and `ACM_IEEE-CS`).  **Note**: Regex can still be used outside of the bracketed patterns. (except for character classes  since they will be interpreted as a bracketed pattern)  #### Issues neither addressed in this PR nor the current master 1. Files that get truncated due to length 2. Character classes in the RegExpBasedFileFinder. In the following pattern  `**/.*[title][a-z]+.*\\.[extension]`  `[a-z]` is treated as if it is a bracketed pattern 3. BracketedExpressions are only expanded in the file name  **not in the directory name**.  #### Checklist  - [x] ~Check if parts can be replaced by a glob (<a href"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)">getPathMatcher</a>)~ - [x] Improve finding and parsing bracketed expressions? - [x] Fix this particular use case using regexp literals (\Q\E in the regexp)     - [x] ~Add type-safety to the expanded bracket (return a compiled Pattern when it is supposed to be a RegularExpression)~ - [x] Check that the expanded bracketed expression result in a correct filename  and/or convert it into one.

Im not sure if its done as expected though  please let me know if I need to change/update anything.  The fixed version behaves like this: If Preferences > Citation key patterns > Overwrite existing keys is unchecked  `generateKey()` in `CitationKeyGenerator`:  * overwrites the default `citationKey` with an newly generated one only  if it is blank * the default `citationKey` is not overwritten anymore (and therefore stays the same)  if it is not blank  Behaviour remains unchanged if Overwrite existing keys is checked. (Let me know if I misunderstood how this feature was supposed to work in general and Ill adapt the behaviour accordingly)  Fixes #7420  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [x] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

Do you have GUI tests?        There is a known problem: "Merge citations" does not save the information needed       to find the optional extra info (like page reference) stored in document properties.       When reestablishing the individual references in unCombineCiteMarkers        getUniqueReferenceMarkName() may or may not return the original name.       When it does not  the extra info may be lost  or even taken from another entry.        A solution could be to encode the number making the originals unique       in the merged name: in stead of  "JR_cite_1_XX2000a YY2010" it would be e.g.       "JR_cite_1_XX2000a 1_YY2010". Apart from construction and parsing         probably marking (or calulating) the originals as "in use" for getUniqueReferenceMarkName()        would be needed.         Another problem: combineCiteMarkers orders the merged entries by year  (I am not sure why).        The original order is lost.         In summary  the presented solution  although improves the situation  does not cover        all aspects.  - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes)  ![jabref-Unmerge-citations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15824666/108429997-fc390200-7240-11eb-9d4c-2766b8342997.png)  - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

Double-click it  and I got errors in console as the following:  ``` Error opening file D:\TEST\test: Could not find a suitable import format. Error opening file whitespace.bib: Could not find a suitable import format. 21:41:53.032 [JabRef - Remote Listener Server on port 6050] ERROR org.jabref.logic.importer.OpenDatabase - Error: File not found ```  Therefore  the path was regarded as two files: `D:\TEST\test` and `whitespace.bib`.  Start from `org.jabref.logic.importer.OpenDatabase` to backtrack the dataflow:  |         Class          |            Method            |      Variable      | | :--------------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------: | |     `OpenDatabase`     |        `loadDatabase`        |    `fileToOpen`    | |  `ArgumentProcessor`   |     `importAndOpenFiles`     |    `aLeftOver`     | |      `JabRefCLI`       |         constructor          |       `args`       | |  `ArgumentProcessor`   |         constructor          |       `args`       | | `JabRefMessageHandler` | `handleCommandlineArguments` |     `message`      | | `RemoteListenerServer` |       `handleMessage`        |     `argument`     | | `RemoteListenerServer` |            `run`             | `input.getValue()` | |       `Protocol`       |       `receiveMessage`       |     `argument`     |    Use logger to print the variable `argument`:  ```java if (argument instanceof String[]) {     LOGGER.info(Arrays.toString((String[]) argument))  } ```  And I got:  ``` 21:41:53.024 [JabRef - Remote Listener Server on port 6050] INFO  org.jabref.logic.remote.shared.Protocol - [D:\TEST\test  whitespace.bib] ```  So I think the problem is that when passing the argument `D:\TEST\test whitespace.bib`  it will be considered as two arguments because there is a whitespace that serves as a delimiter.  I noticed that @zongxian said that a path containing Chinese characters would cause the same error. So the problem is not just related to delimiter  probably about text encoding.  Therefore I encoded the arguments in `RemoteClient.sendCommandLineArguments` and decoded them in `Protocol.receiveMessage`.  Then I created a binary and tested. Now it works well on my computer (Windows 10 1909).

New article 3. BibeTx source adds the following:    ```    @article{杨芙清2005软件工程技术发展思索       title{软件工程技术发展思索}       author{杨芙清}       journal{软件学报}       volume{16}       number{1}       year{2005}       publisher{Citeseer}    }    ``` 4. click "check integrity"   The main reason for this bug is the check-tools `Check integrity` only accept the charset ASCII. It works well in English citations  but  **jabref** has users across the world and they have different charsets.   ### The screenshot: 1. before: ![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220965/115108177-93040f80-9fa1-11eb-99c3-6754a5e82120.jpg)  2. after ![intigrity-check](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220965/115108181-9ac3b400-9fa1-11eb-8dc1-dbad6a5a82e8.jpg)  ### The way to fix: 1. First I find the bug related to the class `ASCIICharacterChecker.java` 2. In this class  ``` boolean asciiOnly  CharMatcher.ascii().matchesAllOf(field.getValue())  ``` any non-ASCII encoded characters will be warned. 3. Then I remove the steps in `IntegrityCheck` .  And still  I want to give a warning about non-UTF8 encoded characters. 1. I get the default encoding from the system (Since we need to give a warning when the field cannot be decoded in UTF-8. And this may happen when users default encoding charset is non-UTF-8) 2. check whether the value of fields(string) can be decoded in UTF-8 3. if not  just give a warning about "Non-UTF-8 encoded found"  To check this  we need first set out the default charset(for example GBK) in the whole environment.  Then we can get the following warning when using Integrity check: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71220965/115108584-e11a1280-9fa3-11eb-843f-b3f3a65857e6.png)

However  the title with curly brackets may fail to search a arXiv entry  or the search is success but the title fails to match the  arXiv title.   ## Process to fix the issue:  1 The arXiv-related work is in the **ArXiv.java**   2 Then I found the url of pdf  is defined in the function **findFullText**  and it further invoke function **searchForEntries**  3 I defined a method called **ignoreCurlyBracket** in **StringUtil.java** to erase the curly brackets in the title if the title is not blank.   4 In the function **searchForEntries**  I invoke **ignoreCurlyBracket** to fix the title before it serve as a parameter to search arXiv entry and before the comparison with arXiv title.  ## Screenshots of  the result:  ### Before  ![image-20210419154425138](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/115348021-af43be80-a1e4-11eb-9989-d3e2fe1635d1.png)   ### After  Download successfully  ![image-20210419205905217](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/115348190-e4501100-a1e4-11eb-8285-19b6cdc19b82.png)  ![image-20210419210151694](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/115348221-f0d46980-a1e4-11eb-8721-d02246ea0463.png)

Then I tried to replace it with normal for loop but the toggle problem still exist  though the exception did not occur any more. By checking the list in each loop I found that the order of the items in this list was changed during the for loop. Not exactly knowing how the sorting strategy is performed  I make a copy of the list and do field change on the copied list.

7663,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,Fixes Jabref#7660 Unable to download some arXiv links if the "eprint" field is missing Fixes #7660 ## Brief summary 1. Run EprintCleanup on a copy of the entry the ArXiv fetcher is fetching before getting arXiv id from the eprint field  2. Add two test method. One finds full text with title containing colon and journal  while another finds full text with title containing colon and url.  ## Problem When finding full text  this BibTeX reference works: ``` @Article{booth_bayes-trex_2020    author         {Serena Booth and Yilun Zhou and Ankit Shah and Julie Shah}    journal        {arXiv:2002.10248v4 [cs]}    title          {Bayes-TrEx: a Bayesian Sampling Approach to Model Transparency by Example}    year           {2020}    month          dec    archiveprefix  {arXiv}    eprint         {2002.10248}    url            {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10248v4}  } ``` ![#7660-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48386227/115873907-13c97c80-a476-11eb-821f-24598bd1a8a9.png)  But when `eprint` field is missing  no full text will be found: ``` @Article{booth_bayes-trex_2020    author         {Serena Booth and Yilun Zhou and Ankit Shah and Julie Shah}    journal        {arXiv:2002.10248v4 [cs]}    title          {Bayes-TrEx: a Bayesian Sampling Approach to Model Transparency by Example}    year           {2020}    month          dec    archiveprefix  {arXiv}    url            {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10248v4}  } ``` ![#7660-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48386227/115873922-188e3080-a476-11eb-80e7-222c58ee4e09.png)  ## Solution Since the title contains colon and arXiv uses colon to represent key and value  the title may be recognized mistakenly. So use other fields to get the eprint field to avoid this problem.

However   some urls may not be wrapped in a style tag and as a result   Jabref cannot parses them.  ## Way to Fix In the xsd file  I change the the complexTypes attribute to `mix"true"`  so that it can accept both vanilla text and subelements. Then I will check whether a style tag exists: if it does  use the text inside it  otherwise  use vanilla text instead.

If not created an issue at <https://github.com/JabRef/user-documentation/issues> or  even better  submitted a pull request to the documentation repository.   ## Reproduce this issue:  1 Choose an entry  click **search full text document online** in **Lookup**  2 If it is the first time you download it  it works well. But if it is not  it will download a duplicate file with the same content  the .bib file will has two duplicate files as below  ``` file     {:banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network (2).pdf:PDF :banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network (1).pdf:PDF :banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network.pdf:PDF}  ```    In this issue  we want to keep the new file with different contents but delete the same one. Thus  after download a new file  we need to first judge whether the file name is the duplicate form like "xxx (1)" compare to the other files in the target directory. If yes  then compare the content of these files sharing the  "similar" name  if the new file has the same content as one of them  then delete it and do not add it to the linked file.    ## Process to fix the issue:  1 The related code is in **LinkedFileViewModel.java**  inside the function **download()**  because we suppose that the file has already been download  the code should be inside **downloadTask.onSuccess**  2 We define a boolean function **isDuplicatedFile** in **FileNameUniqueness.java** to judge whether the file is a duplicated one in content  if yes  the newly downloaded file will be deleted and it will not be added to the linked file.  3 In **FileNameUniqueness.java** we also define function named **eraseDuplicateMarks** to change the file name like "xxx (1)" to "xxx"  and return the same string if it is not in the form of duplicate file name  4 In the boolean function **isDuplicatedFile**  it will first judge whether there are other files have "similar" name with its. If  do not have  return false  indicating not duplicate. If have  compare (use **com.google.common.io.Files.equal**) the content of the newly downloaded file with all the files has "similar" file name  if the content is different from all of them  return false. If one of them has the same content with the new files content  delete the new file   display warning message and return true to indicate duplication happens.      ## **Screenshot of the result**  ####   Use the following .bib file for test  ``` @article{banerjee2020a  	title"A survey on influence maximization in a social network"  	author"Suman {Banerjee} and Mamata {Jenamani} and Dilip Kumar {Pratihar}"  	journal"Knowledge and Information Systems"  	volume"62"  	number"9"  	pages"3417--3455"  	notes"Sourced from Microsoft Academic - https://academic.microsoft.com/paper/3013137889"  	year"2020" } ```  ### **Before**  After **search full text document online** for three times  ![test4_files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117033348-da75f400-ad34-11eb-9c12-4e73fca2f671.png)  ``` file     {:banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network (2).pdf:PDF :banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network (1).pdf:PDF :banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network.pdf:PDF}  ```  ### After ### Test1  After **search full text document online** for three times  ![test5_files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117033557-101add00-ad35-11eb-8af0-5c03871ff447.png)  ![delete_message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117033667-2c1e7e80-ad35-11eb-8ae5-02d6c8899679.png)  ``` file     {:banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network.pdf:PDF}  ```  ### Test2 After test1  in order to test whether it will compare the content of the file  we **replace** the downloaded pdf file "banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network.pdf"  with a new pdf file but keep a same name in the same folder  and then  **search full text document online**   ### The new file:  ![replace_file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117034097-8ddee880-ad35-11eb-93c7-33d1d8c2e0bd.png)   ### The outcome:  ![replace_message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117033863-5ff9a400-ad35-11eb-9d91-99835515109f.png)   ![replace_download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73102892/117034161-9afbd780-ad35-11eb-9120-a0dcbb7defe2.png)  ``` file     {:banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network (1).pdf:PDF :banerjee2020a - A Survey on Influence Maximization in a Social Network.pdf:PDF}  ```
