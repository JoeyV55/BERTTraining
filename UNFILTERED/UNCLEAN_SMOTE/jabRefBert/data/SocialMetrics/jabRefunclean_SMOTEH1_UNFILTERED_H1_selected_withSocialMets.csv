Provided solution:     - Modified RIS ImportFilter. Now RIS format is identified by looking for the "TY" tag (it is a mandatory tag in RIS format and it is not conflictual with other filters)     - Added new ImportFilter "MedlinePlain". This import filter parses Medline files in plain format (not XML). The import filter has been produced referring to the official Medline documentation (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html)     - Updated the net.sf.jabref.core plugin.xml file in order to include the newly added MedlinePlain import filter

It replaces `String[]` in the return types of `BibtexEntryType` with `List<String>`. This allows to return immutable lists instead of mutable arrays and improves the stability of the program. Additionally  the rewrite allowed to replace a lot of duplicate object creation with instance variables.  With respect to #122  the immutability of the new lists removes the necessity to create defensive copies and therefore avoids a lot of cloning.
