[filters]( * the  filesystemwatchers  filter out exe  lnk  appred-ms and url type files and call the  getappfrompath(path)  function which has been added to the win32 class. this function returns the corresponding win32 item which can be added to the list.  * wrappers and interfaces have been added to  filesystemwatcher    system.io.file  and  fileversioninfo  classes so that they can be mocked and tested. *  shelllinkhelper  is implementing the interface  ishelllinkhelper  so that the win32 shortcut programs (lnk) can be tested.  * for shortcut apps   getappfrompath  doesn t give us the expected fullpath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the fullpath is set using the shelllinkhelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the exe fullpath from the lnkfile. * for  deleted  apps since we have no more information to go on  we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkresolved path. * for  renamed  apps  we have more information about the existing app  so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list. this is done so that we have an app which has the same name  exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same.    * manually validated it. * added tests - 1.  to ensure that the we will not be introducing duplicates. 2. for each event {created  renamed  deleted} and app type {exe  lnk  appred-ms  url} a test has been added to validate that the filesystemwatcher work as expected. * all the other program plugin tests pass as well.

* rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed  the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodel s  generalsettingsconfig  a public static variable. * the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up.     public shellpage()         {             initializecomponent()               datacontext = viewmodel              shellhandler = this              viewmodel.initialize(shellframe  navigationview  keyboardaccelerators)              shellframe.navigate(typeof(generalpage))          }     * therefore  the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in it s constructor. the generalviewmodel tries to open the settings.json file and loads the information from it if it exists  if not it creates a new settings.json file. hence  this variable is always initialized when settings is running. this is also the only time the settings.json file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention). from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the  generalsettingsconfig  in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file.   might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol).     _?_  * all tests pass (the format had to be changed for initializing generalsettings based on the code changes). * manually validated in release as well as in debug mode that the crash no longer occurs. * also validated that the converters work as expected by changing the theme.
