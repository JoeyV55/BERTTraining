(similar to what is done for other hooks in powertoys). - earlier the hotkeymanager would process every key event and and store its state in a variable. this had a major issue that it could cause hotkeys to be fired even with the incorrect order for example  <kbd>space</kbd> followed by <kbd>win</kbd> for <kbd>win+space</kbd> which shouldn t happen. this stored state based approach could have other issues as well  which is why it has been changed to use getasynckeystate for all the modifiers and we only consider the last keydown event as the  action key  (space in the above example). this is the same approach used by kbm and fz.  <!-- please review the items on the pr checklist before submitting--> ## pr checklist * [x] applies to #4578  * [x] cla signed. if not  go over [here](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/microsoft/powertoys) and sign the cla  <!-- provide a more detailed description of the pr  other things fixed or any additional comments/features here --> ## detailed description of the pull request / additional comments - to reduce the amount of code refactoring and to make reviewing easier i have made only the sufficient changes to fix all the false positive and unexpected behavior. there is however room for further improvement in these classes. one would be to update the  keyboardevent  data structure to be more similar to what we use for  lowlevelkeyboardevent   so that more information can be considered rather than just the virtual key code and the  wparam . - since we no longer have the additional thread  we can remove the environment.exit(0) statement in settings added in #4496 . i manually validated that the process terminates correctly .  <!-- describe how you validated the behavior. add automated tests wherever possible  but list manual validation steps taken as well --> ## validation steps performed - manually validated that i was able to change the hotkeys for fz and pt run and they would invoke correctly (to test changes on keyboardhook class) - manually validated alt+space  win+a and win+space for pt run by hitting the hotkey a couple of times.

[filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.filesystemwatcher.filters?view=netcore-3.1) * the  filesystemwatchers  filter out exe  lnk  appred-ms and url type files and call the  getappfrompath(path)  function which has been added to the win32 class. this function returns the corresponding win32 item which can be added to the list.  * wrappers and interfaces have been added to  filesystemwatcher    system.io.file  and  fileversioninfo  classes so that they can be mocked and tested. *  shelllinkhelper  is implementing the interface  ishelllinkhelper  so that the win32 shortcut programs (lnk) can be tested.  * for shortcut apps   getappfrompath  doesn t give us the expected fullpath for the deleted and renamed application and therefore it must be treated in a separate way because the fullpath is set using the shelllinkhelper and if the file does not exist we cannot extract the **exe fullpath** from the lnkfile. * for  deleted  apps since we have no more information to go on  we iterate through all the programs and remove the one which has the same lnkresolved path. * for  renamed  apps  we have more information about the existing app  so we construct what could have been the old app so that we can remove it from the list. this is done so that we have an app which has the same name  exe name and full path as the app which was added so that the hashcodes are the same. <!-- describe how you validated the behavior. add automated tests wherever possible  but list manual validation steps taken as well --> ## validation steps performed * manually validated it. * added tests - 1.  to ensure that the we will not be introducing duplicates. 2. for each event {created  renamed  deleted} and app type {exe  lnk  appred-ms  url} a test has been added to validate that the filesystemwatcher work as expected. * all the other program plugin tests pass as well. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28739210/87326150-368e3400-c4e7-11ea-84d5-3f7f14ad7be2.png)

en.xaml files converted to resources.resx for all launcher projects (manually with some ctrl+f and ctrl+h magic along with resgen) - replaced all calls to  gettranslation  by directly referencing the resource with the statement  projectname.properties.resources.resourcename . - the  internationalization  and  language  related classes were removed since there were used only for the language xaml files. since this contained  gettranslation   the  gettranslation  method was removed from  ipublicapi  as well. - modified the tests which checked the number of mocked calls to  gettranslation . instead of checking for a call with a resource name  it was changed to check the values set for the context menu item titles. - for all the projects were resx files were added  the resource class was set to public  and the assembly neutral language was set to en-us. this is the default resource language that will be included in the dll. all other resources would appear in the file path structure  langcode\projectname.resources.dll . - removed all language xaml files for launcher projects from the installer. - removed the wox settings xaml files present in some of the plugin projects. these were used by wox in their settings  however we do not require them in powertoys run. - added locproject.json for all the projects to enable localization on the pipeline  ## pending work (to be done in a separate pr) - remove unused wox strings - some strings are still hardcoded and should be added to the resx files.  ## validation steps performed  _how does someone test & validate?_ - validated that all the plugins run in launcher from vs. - validated that the installer builds and launcher works from the installer. - validated with a dummy resources.fr.resx for indexer plugin with a few strings modified that the french resources are loaded when the os language is changed to french. -

info on pull request  _what does this include?_  the general settings.json file on being accessed by settings was throwing a file in use ioexception because it was being used by another process.   the way settings and runner worked before this pr is as follows: the settings on start-up checks if the general settings.json file exists and reads from it  if not it creates a new one. the runner on the other hand during start-up does not save to the file ( apply_general_settings  is passed with a false save argument). there is no contention during this part.  however  the issue occurs when settings tries to open the general settings.json file everytime it needs information in any viewmodel or converter. when any change is made in the settings  that information is communicated to the runner and it is the runner s responsibility to write to the settings.json file. however  since we have one process continuously trying to read from a file and the other writing to the same file  there is contention.  to fix this issue  the following changes have been made - * rather than adding a retry-block everywhere the settings is being accessed  the need to open the file each time has been removed by making the generalviewmodel s  generalsettingsconfig  a public static variable. * the shell page of settings (which is the base page) loads the general page on start-up.     public shellpage()         {             initializecomponent()               datacontext = viewmodel              shellhandler = this              viewmodel.initialize(shellframe  navigationview  keyboardaccelerators)              shellframe.navigate(typeof(generalpage))          }     * therefore  the general page is the first one to be loaded on start-up and the generalsettingsconfig variable is set in it s constructor. the generalviewmodel tries to open the settings.json file and loads the information from it if it exists  if not it creates a new settings.json file. hence  this variable is always initialized when settings is running. this is also the only time the settings.json file is accessed by the settings process (and as mentioned above on start-up runner does not write to the file so there is no contention). from now on any changes are directly accessed by using the  generalsettingsconfig  in the settings process and passed to the runner which is now the only process accessing that file.   might possibly be related to #6527 as well (even this is a ioexception in the settings hotkeycontrol).  ##

[here](https://claopensourcemicrosoftcom/microsoft/powertoys) and sign the cla* [x] tests added/passed## info on pull request_what does this include?_module changes:- the existing code for enabling/disabling involves removing/adding the registry key which is added during installation but it was set for hkcu reg instead of hklm (in the installer it was changed to hklm in a later release) because of this enabling/disabling could add/remove some unused registry entries this has been changed to hklm to avoid any errors in the future if the code is uncommented- for thumbnail providers the registry modification steps were incorrect so they have been changed accordingly to read/write `hkcr/fileextension/{e357fccd-a995-4576-b01f-234630154e96}` with value as the clsid of the provider- to allow the `fileexplorerpreviewsettings` code to be more usable for future modules `fileexplorerpreviewsettings` was made into an interface with most methods implemented except the registry related methods `previewhandlersettings` and `thumbnailprovidersettings` classes were added which implemented the above interfaces this separation was made since the registry paths and logic differed between the two with this change the two variables for storing the preview handlers and thumbnail providers in `powerpreview` were combined- removed unnecessary arguments in registry wrapper- a `checkregistrystate` method was added to the interface which is used to check if the registry key (for enabling/disabling that module) is already present with the correct values or not- `updatestate` method in the interface was modified such that it takes elevation state as argument after updating the toggle state and checking if the file explorer powertoy is enabled it checks if the registry state already matches the new state if it doesnt it makes the necessary update if pt is elevated or returns a failure if it is not elevated- in `set_config` in `powerpreview` when a setting changes updatestate is called on all the modules and if any of them return a failure a warning message is shown to the user indicating the user would have to restart pt as admin for settings to take effect (this code path would generally not occur in new settings it could occur in old settings though)- in `powerpreview` a wrapper was added which first checks if the registry state of all the modules matches the toggle state and if it doesnt it performs a method if elevation or shows the warning if not elevated- the wrapper is used in enable() so that modules which are enabled as per the toggle setting should be enabled in registry since enable gets called when pt is started if there is a mismatch between the settings if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules- an elevation only check wrapper is also used in disable() so that modules get disabled in registry only if elevated since disable gets called when pt is started if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules- regarding the above 2 points the enable/disable setting is not exposed in new settings but it is in old settings this could cause issues if a user upgrades from old to new settings via windows update and previously disabled file explorer as they can never re-enable itui changes:- the settings format for file explorer was invalid (on c# side) and would get ignored by runner as it had `properties` instead of `properties` that has been fixed- since the registry can be modified only if pt is run as admin additional text has been added to warn the user that the settings can be modified only if run as admin this is visible only if pt is unelevated- when pt is unelevated the toggles and text for these settings are disabled- an additional textblock has been added for thumbnail provider toggles to indicate a reboot might be required for changes to take effect- for checking elevation the  viewmodel has been modified to include the general settings as well (as done in some other settings modules) the iselevated value of the general settings config is used tests have been refactored accordingly to include the extra argument## tests- updated existing powerpreview setregistryvalue tests to check registryvalue as well- split updatestate tests to include elevation status and previewhandler vs thumbnailprovider differences- split enable/disable tests for previewhandler and thumbnailprovider to check correct registry details## feedback required- text on the warning dialogs and the settings page- unused "enable" setting for file explorer the "enable" value for file explorer in the general settings file was used in old settings as there was an external toggle and separate toggles for each handler but there is no toggle in new settings so there is no way to modify that value if a user was using old settings (ie old windows version) and had

the existing code for enabling/disabling involves removing/adding the registry key which is added during installation but it was set for hkcu reg instead of hklm (in the installer it was changed to hklm in a later release). because of this enabling/disabling could add/remove some unused registry entries. this has been changed to hklm to avoid any errors in the future if the code is uncommented. - for thumbnail providers the registry modification steps were incorrect  so they have been changed accordingly to read/write  hkcr/fileextension/{e357fccd-a995-4576-b01f-234630154e96}  with value as the clsid of the provider - to allow the  fileexplorerpreviewsettings  code to be more usable for future modules   fileexplorerpreviewsettings  was made into an interface with most methods implemented except the registry related methods.  previewhandlersettings  and  thumbnailprovidersettings  classes were added which implemented the above interfaces. this separation was made since the registry paths and logic differed between the two. with this change the two variables for storing the preview handlers and thumbnail providers in  powerpreview  were combined. - removed unnecessary arguments in registry wrapper - a  checkregistrystate  method was added to the interface which is used to check if the registry key (for enabling/disabling that module) is already present with the correct values or not -  updatestate  method in the interface was modified such that it takes elevation state as argument. after updating the toggle state and checking if the file explorer powertoy is enabled it checks if the registry state already matches the new state. if it doesn t it makes the necessary update if pt is elevated or returns a failure if it is not elevated. - in  set_config  in  powerpreview  when a setting changes updatestate is called on all the modules  and if any of them return a failure  a warning message is shown to the user indicating the user would have to restart pt as admin for settings to take effect. (this code path would generally not occur in new settings  it could occur in old settings though). - in  powerpreview   a wrapper was added which first checks if the registry state of all the modules matches the toggle state  and if it doesn t it performs a method if elevation or shows the warning if not elevated. - the wrapper is used in enable()  so that modules which are enabled as per the toggle setting should be enabled in registry. since enable gets called when pt is started  if there is a mismatch between the settings if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning  and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules. - an elevation only check wrapper is also used in disable()  so that modules get disabled in registry only if elevated. since disable gets called when pt is started  if pt is not elevated it will throw a warning  and if it is elevated it will update the registry for all these modules. - regarding the above 2 points  the enable/disable setting is not exposed in new settings but it is in old settings. this could cause issues if a user upgrades from old to new settings via windows update and previously disabled file explorer as they can never re-enable it.  ui changes: - the settings format for file explorer was invalid (on c# side) and would get ignored by runner as it had  properties  instead of  properties   that has been fixed. - since the registry can be modified only if pt is run as admin  additional text has been added to warn the user that the settings can be modified only if run as admin. this is visible only if pt is unelevated - when pt is unelevated the toggles and text for these settings are disabled - an additional textblock has been added for thumbnail provider toggles to indicate a reboot might be required for changes to take effect. - for checking elevation the  viewmodel has been modified to include the general settings as well (as done in some other settings modules). the iselevated value of the general settings config is used. tests have been refactored accordingly to include the extra argument   ## tests - updated existing powerpreview setregistryvalue tests to check registryvalue as well - split updatestate tests to include elevation status and previewhandler vs thumbnailprovider differences - split enable/disable tests for previewhandler and thumbnailprovider to check correct registry details  ## feedback required - text on the warning dialogs and the settings page - unused  enable  setting for file explorer. the  enable  value for file explorer in the general settings file was used in old settings as there was an external toggle and separate toggles for each handler  but there is no toggle in new settings  so there is no way to modify that value. if a user was using old settings (i.e. old windows version) and had file explorer disabled  when they move the new settings by windows update  the setting will still be disabled but it cannot be changed from pt settings  and the user has to manually modify the json. should we deprecate that or add another toggle which results in all the handlers getting disabled? (the equivalent of the enable toggles for a powertoy as a whole). - modifying registry when running pt from vs (and pt isn t installed)  could lead to bad registry. this could affect devs  ## validation steps performed  _how does someone test & validate?_ - build and install msi - before running pt  validate that .md/.svg preview handlers are working and svg thumbnails are working - check your general settings json file and file explorer settings file. based on the values you should see one of the scenarios (similarly when powertoys isn t running you can modify the file to one of the scenarios below to check if the expected behavior occurs). run powertoys elevated/unelevated and check the corresponding row. the expected behavior below assumes that all 3 modules are enabled in the registry (as would occur in a fresh install). if file explorer is enabled in general settings  for any other registry state basically if the json and registry states don t match  in case of unelevated powertoys it will throw a warning  and if it is elevated it will make the changes as per json. if file explorer is not enabled  all of them will always be disabled.   | file explorer in general settings | file explorer settings (svg-ph  svg-tp  md-ph) | elevation | behavior                                                  | |-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------| | enabled                           | all enabled                                    | false     | no warning and all 3 work                                 | | enabled                           | all enabled                                    | true      | no warning and all 3 work                                 | | disabled                          | any combination                                | false     | warning and all 3 work                                    | | disabled                          | any combination                                | true      | no warning and all 3 disabled                             | | enabled                           | at least one disabled                          | false     | warning and all 3 work                                    | | enabled                           | at least one disabled                          | true      | no warning  and only the ones which are enabled will work |

the containing methods and call paths don t seem to catch them but they should only occur from programmer error. in particular  i had to add these to a group of viewmodel constructors where the arguments  the settingsutils and settingsrepository  are instantiated immediately before the constructors are called (i.e. they should never be null) in their respective page classes. if these constructors are modified in the future  any exceptions should blow up at development time.  ## validation steps performed  check that the fxcop warnings above are dealt with and that the related tests pass.
